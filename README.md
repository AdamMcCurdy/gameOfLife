This is the result of a coding challenge to recreate the game of life. 

Left click to paint live cells
Right click to paint dead cells

Space bar to play / pause the scene. 

Things that interest me about the game of life are: 
1. Turing complete systems that allow you to replicate the current game on a high level of abstraction.
2. Fractal nature of code
3. Reduction and chaos
4. Simulation theory
5. Von Neumann probes
6. And more!
